A 300-litre fridge was used to store her body parts, which were individually disposed in the Chhatarpur forest over the next 18 days, at around 2 AM every night to avoid suspicion.",

      "whoIsJihadi": "Aaftab Poonawala was a Muslim boy worked at the same MNC call center as Shraddha Walkar. He confessed to the murder (Love Jihad) after the police discovered discrepancies in his statements and recovered evidence of the murder. He was then taken to the forest to identify Shraddha's remains."
